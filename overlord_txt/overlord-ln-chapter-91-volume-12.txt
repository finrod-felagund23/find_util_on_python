Volume 12 Afterword, Character Sheets and Credits
Afterword
I’m sure that as children, many people must have wished for August to be sixty days long when they were doing their holiday homework while their parents scolded them, or when they flipped through the calendar in August.
Maruyama has always been that way. He thought that way when he forgot to do his homework and had to raise his hand up on the first day of school in September.
However, this time, I made it real!
My childhood dream came true! Maruyama wanted to become an adult like this in the past, and now it’s become reality! Oh what a wonderful thing!
Everyone’s — I guess I should stop here. Spouting these pointless excuses to drag things out won’t help things.
Therefore, while it was slightly delayed, we managed to publish the book at last. Well, this ought to be within the margin of error. No, the truth is that it was because a lot of things happened. Seriously, there were a lot of them both good and bad.
Speaking of which, Maruyama bought several ebooks while in hospital, ebooks are really great! I didn’t expect them to be handy. I think it would be good for Overlord to have an ebook version. Therefore, I have decided to convert Overlord into a digital format. As I thought, there are many things that humans won’t understand if they don’t try them out. Similarly, if you are not involved in a situation, there’s many things you won’t understand about it.
Incidentally, while this is offtopic, the ebooks I read were manga, specifically love comedies.
Now then, last of all, I need to thank a lot of people. In particular, the people holding this book, as well as a certain hospital.
I’ll be glad if I can meet you again in the next volume. Thank you very much, everyone.
